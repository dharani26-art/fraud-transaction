# fraud-transaction
The primary objective of the Fraud Detection of Financial Data project is to develop a machine learning-based classification system to accurately predict whether a financial transaction is fraudulent or non-fraudulent using the PaySimi synthetic dataset. The system aims to preprocess the dataset to handle class imbalance, train multiple classification models (Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gaussian Naive Bayes), and deploy the best-performing model (Random Forest) through a user-friendly Flask web application. The goal is to achieve high accuracy in fraud detection and provide a practical interface for users to input transaction details and receive real-time predictions.
